            Founded in 2025, InstaNest was created to blend the warmth of a home
            with the luxury of a hotel. What began as a small family-run
            property is now a top-rated destination known for comfort, class,
            and heartfelt service. Our guests are not just visitors â€” they're
            part of our story.
